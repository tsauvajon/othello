#React Othello
Othello (also called Reversi) is a strategic 2 players game, where the goal is to have more pawns than your opponent at the end of the game.
This application was made with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). It is currently only playable by taking turns on the same computer / same page. I'm also building a [WebSocket multiplayer version](https://github.com/tsauvajon/othello-websocket) of this application, using (mainly) NodeJS, socket.io and React.
